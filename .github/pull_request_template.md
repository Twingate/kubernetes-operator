## Notes

Elaborate things that the reviewer should be aware, for example, alternative
approached considered, constraints in 3rd party APIs, etc. Some explanation
should be an inline comment at the code change because the code would provide
more context to the reader.

For bug fixes, please also include

- Steps to reproduce if they are not already in the Linear ticket
- Root cause
- If possible, link to the PR where the regression was introduced

PLEASE REMOVE THIS SECTION IF IT'S NOT APPLICABLE.
