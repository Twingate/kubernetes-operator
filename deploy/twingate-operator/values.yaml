# Default values for twingate-operator.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Twingate operator configurations
#
# **Required**: you have to specify `network` and
#  - either `apiKey` or `existingAPIKeySecret`
#  - either `remoteNetworkId`, `remoteNetworkName` or `existingRemoteNetworkIdSecret`
#
# **Restricting Operator to Specific Namespaces**
# Use the `namespaces` property to restrict operator to monitor resources only in specific namespaces.
# You can either:
#  1. Specify a list of namespaces: ["foo-dev", "foo-stg"]
#  2. Use globs to match multiple namespaces: ["*-dev", "*-stg"]
#  3. Use negation to include all namespaces except those excluded: ["!kube-*"]
#  4. Use multiple globs in one pattern: ["foo-*,!*-test"]
#
# Default value is an empty list (`[]`) which means operator will monitor or all namespaces.
#
# *Note:* Defining glob patterns as a separate array elements is different from defining
# comma-separated patterns within a single element.
# For example, `namespaces: ["foo-*", "!*-test"]` is not the same as `namespaces: ["foo-*,!*-test"]`
# `namespaces: ["foo-*", "!*-test"]` will evaluate each glob pattern independently and combine the results.
